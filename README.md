I’m Daniel (@danielmbsales)
A biotech-curious, code-slinging thinker who’s probably overanalyzing something right now.

What Keeps Me Going - 
Diving deep into biotechnology, genomics, and Python scripting...Sometimes epistemology...
Chasing wild ideas that might never see the finish line (thanks, ADHD!!!).

What I’m Tinkering With - 
Hacking away at genomics scripts.

Collab Radar - 
Dream gig: Blending tech research with philosophical theory.
Hit me up if you’re into biotech, code, or debating what’s knowable.

How to Find Me - 
Slide into my DMs.

Random Trivia - 
Fun fact: I once Googled “how to substitute batteries for potatoes.” (Spoiler: It’s messy.)
Current obsession: Re-watching old TV series like it’s a full-time job. (Prison Break today!)
