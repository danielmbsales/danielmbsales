# Hey there, I'm Daniel! 👋

I'm a **Pharmacy & Systems Development** student passionate about bridging technology and healthcare. My journey blends **bioinformatics, computational pharmacology, and data analysis**, with a sprinkle of curiosity for how code can solve real-world problems. Currently in my 6th semester of Pharmacy at UNINASSAU and pursuing a Technical Degree in Systems Development, I’m diving deep into Python, SQL, and data-driven projects.

## 🌱 What I'm Working On

Building tools for DNA sequence analysis and drug discovery using Python and Pandas.

Exploring databases (like PostgreSQL) to manage and analyze biological data.

Crafting projects that merge my love for biotechnology and coding, with a focus on practical applications in pharmacology.

## 🛠️ My Toolkit

**Languages:** Python, SQL, Java (soon)

**Tools & Libraries:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Biopython, Git

**Interests:** Bioinformatics, Computational Pharmacology, Data Analysis

## 🤝 Let’s Collaborate!

I’m always excited to connect on technological research or philosophical discussions about science and coding. Got an idea for a project in bioinformatics or drug hunting? DM me on X or LinkedIn—I’ll get back to you when I can!

## 📫 Get in Touch

Check out my projects below or reach me via GitHub.

I’m always up for a chat about code, science, or the meaning of life!
